# octamap-octree

This repository includes some of octree algorithm codes and what is octree and octamap .

An octree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children. Octrees are most often used to partition 
a three-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants. Octrees are the three-dimensional analog of quadtrees. 
The name is formed from oct + tree, but note that it is normally written "octree" with only one "t". Octrees are often used in 
3D graphics and 3D game engines.
